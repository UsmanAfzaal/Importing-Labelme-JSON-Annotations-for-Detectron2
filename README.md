# Importing-Labelme-JSON-Annotations-for-Detectron2

These codes are inspired by facebook's detectron2 code.
Use these files to import and train a custom instance segmentation dataset made by "Labelme" on facebook's detectron2.

CocoAnnotationGeneration.py
  This file converts the annotations into mscoco annotations, which are later used in training.
  
ImportingCustomDataset.py
  With this you can directly register the dataset from the files generated by CocoAnnotationGeneration.py
  
  
Arrange your dataset directory as follows.

var routes = (
  <Route name="Dataset">
    <Route name="Admin">
     <Route name="Train"/>

    </Route>
);
